This should be a readily recongnisable name for you organisation, and is intended to be a large group of resources that comprise that application.
A common mistake with Azure (and other clouds), is creating too many "applications", like spliting thing into integration, website, database etc...
This usually just makes it harder to manage, so we recommend that you create a single application for each "application" that you are deploying.
Unlike what you may have experience on-premises, put the components like a frontend and database in the same namespace (like as application) you can still every securely separate them from both a security and opertational perspecitve.
The default is "main". Another good options would be "default" but even better would be your internal application name.

This would be usualy, typically you would only deploy the application once per landing zone, once in UAT, once in DEV and once in SIT etc..
However, sometimes in DEV for example, you need to support multiple developer teams, working on the same code or different parts of the project and they historically clash.
The default is "default" and we recommend you pick a project_name and stick to the same one. 
It should only be changed, when in the special case of deploying the same app in the same landing zone more than once.

An application landing zone consist of a set of secure, compliant and container type resources, intended to support many applications, web sites and databases.
Some people in our opinion, over use landing zones and create too many of them, which makes it harder to manage.

(Required) The sku_name (only specific values) of the resource to be created (free, basic, standard, premium or isolated)
The higher the sku, the more capabilities such as high availability and auto scalling are available.
These modules, determine which sku_name corresponds to which actual Azure SKU, that you would like to deploy.
Obviously, this is subject to opinion, so whilst we are configdent our choices work well in most environments, you are free to adjust this module to so that you can use the same sku_name across all modules.
The higher end skus (premium, isolated) are typically very expensive and totaly overkill for most applications.
Note: The free sku is only applicable to some resources and in some cases the resources created with the "free" sku may not actually be free, but should be very minimal cost.
The validation rules, only permit the use of the "free" and "basic" sku to prevent unintended consequences (ie a huge bill at the end of the month)
The module will happily create these higher SKU resource, so simply edit the validation rule (below) to leverage them.

Feel free to adjust the module as you see fit, but we are pretty confident our resources are pretty reasonable for most circumstances.
The support vaalues are "small", "medium", "large" or "x-large"

variable "private_endpoints_always_deployed" {
  description = <<CONTENT
(Required) private_endpoints_always_deployed (true or false) If private endpoints should be deployed, where available. This requires the sku_name to be either "premium" or "isolated"
The use of Private Endpoints is typically a hardcore requirement for hosting real data. Any PEN test will almost always want Private Endpoints everywhere.
Looking at the Azure Pricing, you might think that Private Endpoints arn't that expensive. But you would be WROMG!
You are paying for the private endpoint basically for every second that it exists. It does not take long for these costs to add up.
Unless you are hosting real data (PII and PHI) then you should not use Private Endpoints, unless you want to waste money, and for really large organisation this might not be a concern.
We have as a separate configuration option for private endpoints, because sometimes people want to test private endpoints in DEV scenarios.
Technically private endpoint should never be needed, as any Azure endpoint is protected via Entra ID authentcation/authorisation, but this is a single point of failure. If Entra was misconfigured for example, your data would potneitally be exposed.
Hence, Prviate Endpoints are a good idea, by providing a 2nd layer of security (look up the swiss cheese approach to security. But they ultimately NOT CHEAP
The default is false And, it can only be set to true, unless the sku_name is set to either "premium" or "isolated".
